The process of validating the identity of the requestor using various methods be it a single-factor authentication or multi-factor authentication. 
There are common ways of authetication are:
-   Something you know: Passwords or paraphrases
-   Something you have: Tokens, memory cards, smart cards
-   Something you are: Biometrics , measurable characteristics

 Common best practice is to implement at least two of the three common techniques for authentication: 
- ### Knowledge-based 
	 Knowledge-based authentication uses a passphrase or secret code to differentiate between an authorized and unauthorized user.The problem with using this type of authentication alone is that it is often vulnerable to a variety of attacks.
- ### Token-based 
	 Any physical things the user posses that can be used to authenticate the identity of the user is tokens. They are usually used alongside knowledge-based techniques to add an extra layer of security.
- ### Characteristic-based
	 The characters possessed by the user that can be used to validate the identity of anyone is character based. User's photograph, their biometrics etc can be used as a character based technique to authenticate users.

## Non-repudiation
[Non-repudiation](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_01/module_01/ch01-m01-Non-repudiation.html?d2lSessionVal=rYyf53YUZOBniUz8i2rZiCXre&ou=9541&d2l_body_type=3#) is a legal term and is defined as the protection against an individual falsely denying having performed a particular action. People may deny having performed some task like purchases or various other transactions and may denyhaving done so afterwards. Non-repudiation helps prevent these activities by holding those people accountable.

## Privacy 
[Privacy](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_01/module_01/ch01-m01-Privacy.html?d2lSessionVal=rYyf53YUZOBniUz8i2rZiCXre&ou=9541&d2l_body_type=3#) is the right of an individual to control the distribution of information about themselves. While security and privacy both focus on the protection of personal and sensitive data, there is a difference between them.
