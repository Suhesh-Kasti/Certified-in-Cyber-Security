**Availability** can be defined as timely and reliable access to information and the ability to use it.  For authorized users, timely and reliable access to data and information services is pretty crutial and it should be available in any format required.
The core concept of availabilty doesnot ask from information to be available 100% of times but readily and reliably available when the need be.
Some systems and data are far more critical than others, so the security professional must ensure that the appropriate levels of availability are provided. This requires consultation with the involved business to ensure that critical systems are identified and available.

### Criticality
Not all documents share the same amount of importance. The measure of degree to which an organization depends on the information or the information system for the success of any objective or the business function.
