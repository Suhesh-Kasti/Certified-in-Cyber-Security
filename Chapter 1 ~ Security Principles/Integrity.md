**Integrity** measures the degree to which something is whole and complete, internally consistent and correct. The concept of integrity applies to:

-   information or data
-   systems and processes for business operations
-   organizations
-   people and their actions
Integrity is a primary factor in the reliability of information and systems.

## [Data Integrity](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_01/module_01/ch01-m01-CIA_Triad_Deep_Dive.html?d2lSessionVal=QYdsOLR3jFmqhRj5UCTnupPc4&ou=9541&d2l_body_type=3#)
Data integrity refers to the assurance that any information is free of any alteration from unauthorized parties. If any data has been tampered with while in storage, during processing or in transit, by any unauthorized pernonnel then that information may not be accurate and hence will have lost its integrity.  Consistency, as part of data integrity, requires that all instances of the data be identical in form, content and meaning.

## [System Integrity](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_01/module_01/ch01-m01-CIA_Triad_Deep_Dive.html?d2lSessionVal=QYdsOLR3jFmqhRj5UCTnupPc4&ou=9541&d2l_body_type=3#)
Quality of a system while it performs its intended functions of either it has been tampered with or manipulated whether intentionally or accidental.

### Baseline
A baseline can be use to insure the integrity of any data or system. 
When a data is deemed protected and not altered it can be made a baseline. Going forward from that baseline, the integrity of the data or the system can always be ascertained by comparing the baseline with the current state. If the two match, then the integrity of the data or the system is intact; if the two do not match, then the integrity of the data or the system has been compromised.
