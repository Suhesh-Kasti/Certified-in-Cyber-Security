The process of validating the identity of the requestor using various methods be it a single-factor authentication or multi-factor authentication. 
There are common ways of authetication are:
-   Something you know: Passwords or paraphrases
-   Something you have: Tokens, memory cards, smart cards
-   Something you are: Biometrics , measurable characteristics

 Common best practice is to implement at least two of the three common techniques for authentication: 
- ### Knowledge-based 
	 Knowledge-based authentication uses a passphrase or secret code to differentiate between an authorized and unauthorized user.The problem with using this type of authentication alone is that it is often vulnerable to a variety of attacks.
- ### Token-based 
	 Any physical things the user posses that can be used to authenticate the identity of the user is tokens. They are usually used alongside knowledge-based techniques to add an extra layer of security.
- ### Characteristic-based
	 The characters possessed by the user that can be used to validate the identity of anyone is character based. User's photograph, their biometrics etc can be used as a character based technique to authenticate users.
