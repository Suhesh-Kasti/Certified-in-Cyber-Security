Far too often organizations fail to proactively manage risk. The level of cyber security required is totally dependent on the level of risk the organization is willing to take. Security professionals use their knowledge and skills to examine operational risk management, determine how to use risk data effectively, work cross-functionally and report actionable information and findings to the stakeholders concerned.

## Vulnarability
Vulnarability refers to any weakness or flaw in an organization's protection system. Anything that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the organization's information or potentially harm an organization is a vulnarability.

## Threat
Threat is someone or something with an intention of exploiting a vulnarability to gain unauthorized access to the system of an organization.
In the context of cybersecurity, typical [threat actors](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_01/module_02/ch01-m02-Threats.html?d2lSessionVal=rYyf53YUZOBniUz8i2rZiCXre&ou=9541&d2l_body_type=3#) include the following:
1. Insiders ~ either deliberately, by simple human error, or by gross incompetence
2. Outside individuals or informal groups ~ either planned or opportunistic, discovering vulnerability
3. Formal entities that are nonpolitical ~ such as business competitors and cybercriminals
4. Formal entities that are political ~ such as terrorists, nation-states, and hacktivists
5. Intelligence or information gatherers ~ could be any of the above
6. Technology ~ such as free-running bots and artificial intelligence , which could be part of any of the above
_***Threat Vector:** The means by which a threat actor carries out their objectives._
